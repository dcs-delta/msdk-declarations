# Î” MSDK Declarations
This package contains the type declarations for the DCS Mission Scripting Environment, essentially everything that scripts bundled with missions have access to.

## Usage
Usage instructions to come. Essentially:
- Install this package (`@dcs-delta/msdk-declarations`) as dev dependency along with `typescript-to-lua`
- In your `tsconfig.json`, under `compilerOptions`, add `"types": ["@dcs-delta/msdk-declarations"]`
- Types should be available as globals, note however that once declarations are mostly in, I'll most likely switch to an import/export system instead of using globals
